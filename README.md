# News-Text-Classification-with-improved-CNN-and-LSTM

The main goal of this project is to automatically classify news articles based on multiple news topics. 

We conduct experiments on two datasets: Wikipedia GloVe dataset Jeffrey Pennington  et al(2014) and 20_newsgroup dataset Ken Lang(1997).

We try four models: Conv1D, LSTM, Stacked LSTM and Conv1D+LSTM.
